    Script by Tobias00723
    from the TGFB server
    Discord : [https://discord.gg/hEHd4A3czx](https://discord.gg/hEHd4A3czx)
    any questions?                   ^^
    find me on my discord server     ^^

    These scripts are opensource and free to use for everybody.
    But i would appreaciate some credit if you "borrow" some code ;p


## description 
    This script will search in a given directory and load all .lua files
    you can also put some files in a exclude table these .lua files will not be loaded then

    This scripts to provide a fast development prosess
    you just need to restart your mission and all changes of your .lua files are saved 
    and loaded  in the mission

    this script should be a drag and drop replacement for all DCS missions
    The scripts are loaded in aphabetical order (order of file explorer by default)
    so but i whould recomment puting all your API files
    like MIST and MOOSE in a .API or API folder
## Features

- Easy to use and a drop in replacement in all missions
- Dynamic loading of files
- Safe and secure way to hide your .lua files
- Error detection of your files
- Exclude table for files you dont want to load


## Installation

    First we need to de-sanitize your MissionScripting.lua file
    located in your DCS install directory (DCSWorld\Scripts\MissionScripting.lua)
    DCS likes to revert this after some updates the script will tell you if you dit this wrong :)
    you can replace the MissionScripting.lua file with the one included in the repo

    in your mission make a new trigger "on mission start" 
    you can also load it in on a delay if you see fit

after that simple "do file" and select the "DCS_Dynamic_Script_loader_Tobias00723.lua" file
it should look something like this :
