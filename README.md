    Script by Tobias00723
    from the TGFB server
    Discord : https://discord.gg/hEHd4A3czx
    any questions?                   ^^
    find me on my discord server     ^^

    These scripts are opensource and free to use for everybody.
    But i would appreaciate some credit if you "borrow" some code ;p

    

    This script will search in a given directory and load all .lua files
    you can also put some files in a exclude table these .lua files will not be loaded then

    This scripts to provide a fast development prosess because these scripts are dynamicly loaded
    you just need to restart your mission and all changes of your .lua files are saved and loaded in the mission

    this script should be a drag and drop replacement for all DCS missions
    The scripts are loaded in aphabetical order (order of file explorer by default)
    so but i whould recomment puting all your API files
    like MIST and MOOSE in a .API or API folder
